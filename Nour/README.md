### Step 1: Install PipeWire and Pulse compatibility

```sudo apt install pipewire-audio-client-libraries pipewire-pulse wireplumber```
### Step 2: Disable PulseAudio

```systemctl --user --now disable pulseaudio.service pulseaudio.socket```
### Step 3: Enable PipeWire audio

```systemctl --user --now enable pipewire.service pipewire-pulse.service```
### Step 4: Reboot

you will still get the error but it will work
